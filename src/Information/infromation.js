                    <p >During 1969 and 1977,  NASA performed a series of experiments to study the moon's structure, called ALSEP( Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package). These experiments were a collection of geophysical instruments designed to monitor and analyze the landing sites after astronauts left the moon’s surface. Designed for a life of one year, they ended up working for over 8 years.</p>
